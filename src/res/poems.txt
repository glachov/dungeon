TITLE: A Coat
AUTHOR: WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS
CONTENT: I made my song a coat
         Covered with embroideries
         Out of old mythologies
         From heel to throat;
         But the fools caught it,
         Wore it in the world’s eyes
         As though they’d wrought it.
         Song, let them take it
         For there’s more enterprise
         In walking naked.

TITLE: The road not taken
AUTHOR: ROBERT FROST
CONTENT: The road not taken
         Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
         And sorry I could not travel both
         And be one traveler, long I stood
         And looked down one as far as I could
         To where it bent in the undergrowth;
         Then took the other, as just as fair,
         And having perhaps the better claim,
         Because it was grassy and wanted wear
         Though as for that the passing there
         Had worn them really about the same,
         And both that morning equally lay
         In leaves no step had trodden black.
         Oh, I kept the first for another day!
         Yet knowing how way leads onto way,
         I doubted if I should ever come back.
         I shall be telling this with a sigh
         Somewhere ages and ages hence;
         Two roads diverged in a wood, and I
         I took the one less traveled by,
         And that has made all the difference.
